# My Ender 3v2

This is my current project 3D printer which I basically ship of theseused.

I got this to learn about 3D printing and Klipper. The goals were always for it to be as DIY as possible.

Notrable upgrades:

* SKR Mini E3 v3 (main MCU)
* KlackEnder/3D Touch (Swappable with 3D touch preffered)
